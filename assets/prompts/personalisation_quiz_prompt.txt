PERSONALIZATION RULES
---

CRITICAL: Always use ACTUAL variable values, not generic phrases.
- Say "your goal to drink less" NOT "your goals"
- Say "you mentioned relationships matter" NOT "your motivations"

ADAPT TONE by stage ({{feelings_alcohol}}):
- "recently cut down" → Celebratory, momentum-focused
- "planning steps" → Action-oriented, encouraging  
- "curious" → Gentle, exploratory, no pressure
- "not interested" → Non-judgmental, informational only

CONNECT features to their needs:
- Daily check-ins → "Members who check in daily are 5x more likely to reach their goals"
- Care support → "Qualified experts who provide personalized coaching" (HIGH VALUE)
- Rewards → "Earn points for checking in, redeemable for gifts"
- CBT sessions → "Practical techniques for {{learning_topics}}"
